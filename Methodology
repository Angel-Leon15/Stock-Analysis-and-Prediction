# Methodology

This document explains the methodology used in the **Stock Analysis and Prediction Tool**, including data sources, preprocessing, analysis, and forecasting.

---

## 1. Data Collection
- **Source**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) via the `yfinance` Python library.  
- **Data Retrieved**:
  - Historical stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).  
  - Current stock information (bid, ask, market cap, etc.).  
  - Option chains for a given expiration date.  

---

## 2. Data Preprocessing
- Convert raw Yahoo Finance data into a **pandas DataFrame**.  
- Handle missing values (forward fill or interpolation if required).  
- Convert timestamps into Python `datetime` objects for easier analysis.  
- Normalize certain fields when required for comparison across stocks.  

---

## 3. Exploratory Analysis
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib` is used to plot stock prices, volumes, and trends.  
- **Summary Statistics**: Average price, volatility, daily returns, and correlation analysis.  
- **Indicators** (optional future extension): Moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands.  

---

## 4. Option Chain Retrieval
- Fetch option chain data for selected expiration dates.  
- Display call and put option details (strike price, open interest, implied volatility).  
- Allow users to inspect derivative pricing and possible hedging strategies.  

---

## 5. Forecasting & Prediction
- **Model Used**: [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) (developed by Facebook/Meta).  
- **Why Prophet?**
  - Handles seasonality and trends well.  
  - Robust to missing data and outliers.  
  - Easy to interpret forecast results.  
- **Steps**:
  1. Format stock price history into Prophet-compatible format (`ds`, `y`).  
  2. Train Prophet model on historical closing prices.  
  3. Generate forecasts for user-defined horizons (e.g., 30 days ahead).  
  4. Plot predicted trend with confidence intervals.

## 6. Limitations
- **Market unpredictability**: Forecasts are based only on historical price data; unexpected events (earnings, news, policy changes) are not captured.  
- **Short-term focus**: Predictions are more reliable for short horizons (e.g., weeks) than for years.  
- **No financial advice**: This tool is for **educational and research purposes only**.  

---

## 7. Future Improvements
- Add more advanced machine learning models (LSTMs, XGBoost).  
- Include more financial indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands).  
- Integrate sentiment analysis from news or social media.  
- Build a simple web dashboard for visualization.
