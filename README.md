# Stock Analysis and Prediction Tool

This Python project utilizes various libraries to fetch, analyze, and predict stock prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. It is designed to provide insights into stock trends, basic properties, and option chains, as well as forecast future prices using Facebook's Prophet library for time series forecasting.

## Features

- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Fetch historical stock data.
- **Stock Information Display**: Show detailed information about the stock such as bid price, open price, previous close, etc.
- **Option Chain Retrieval**: Get the option chain for a stock for a specific expiration date.
- **Basic Stock Properties Display**: Show basic properties of the stock like the current price and volume.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Analyze trends and predict future stock prices using advanced statistical models.
